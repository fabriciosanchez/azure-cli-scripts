DEMO 3 - Migrating a local database to Azure SQL database
============================================================================

################ PART 1 - PRE-REQ ######################################

1.  Enable the TCP/IP protocol, which is disabled by default during SQL Server 
    Express installation, by following the instructions in the article Enable or 
    Disable a Server Network Protocol.

2.  Create an instance of Azure SQL Database (already done by Demo 1)

3.  Install the Data Migration Assistant v3.3 or later

4.  Create a VNET for the Azure Database Migration Service

5.  Ensure that your Azure Virtual Network (VNET) Network Security Group rules 
    do not block the following communication ports 443, 53, 9354, 445, 12000

6.  Configure your Windows Firewall for database engine access

7.  Open your Windows firewall to allow the Azure Database Migration Service 
    to access the source SQL Server, which by default is TCP port 1433

8.  If you are running multiple named SQL Server instances using dynamic ports, 
    you may wish to enable the SQL Browser Service and allow access to UDP port 
    1434 through your firewalls so that the Azure Database Migration Service can 
    connect to a named instance on your source server.

9.  Create a server-level firewall rule for the Azure SQL Database server to 
    allow the Azure Database Migration Service access to the target databases. 
    
10. Provide the subnet range of the VNET used for the Azure Database Migration 
    Service.


##################### PART 2 - ASSESSMENT ##################################

1.  Connect to the local database to show what we're going to migrate to our
    online instance into Azure.

2.  Execute Data Migration Assistant and execute the local assessment.

3. Export and save the assessment's result.
